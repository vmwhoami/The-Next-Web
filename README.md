# The Next Web Webpage Clone

The goal of this project is to build a responsive clone of [The Next Web website](https://thenextweb.com/)

> In this project, we made use of Grids, Flexbox and Positions and layout elements on the page correctly.

> Media queries were used to target "different‚Äù screen sizes in order for us to effectively and efficiently let the website fit correctly to each screen size.

> Building this project was fun as we practiced different css rules and effectively¬†combine grids, flex and position.
